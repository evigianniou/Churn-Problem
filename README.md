Descriptive Task

Characteristics of loyal and churn customers:
Customers taking a longer contract(2 years contruct)are more loyal to the company and tend to stay with it for a longer
period of time.Customers who dont churn tend to stay for a longer tenure with the telecom company Customers who have month to month contract have a very high churn rate.
Senior citizens have almost double the churn rate than younger population When monthly charges are high a big percent of customers churn.The absence of online security is also
a reason that make customers to churn. Most churn customers are those who have contract only for a month (this is logical as after the end of their contract is most possible to leave
their "product" than others who have longer contracts), and those who dont have services like tech support and online security and also those who use fiber optic internet
servise(which surprisingly means faster internet) because probably it is more expensive and also because the most of churn customers are senior citizens who probably dont need
very fast internet. Proposed system The system I would suggest to the Telecom company is to always make a two-year contract with its customers, to have DSL internet service and
to include tech support in the contract.

Predictive Task:
The predictive model used for our test set is Gradient Boosting Algorithm with smote sampling and tree based feature selection. 

The expected cost for the company in one month will be 5709 Euros
